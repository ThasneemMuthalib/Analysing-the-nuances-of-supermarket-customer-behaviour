## Abstract
Customer is king in business, and meeting their needs is crucial for success. Currently supermarkets are gaining attention from customers since the convenience of grocery shopping. However, there is a dearth of thorough research in this field, and current studies lack the detail needed to guide efficient retail marketing techniques especially in Sri Lanka. This research uses a multifaceted approach to explore supermarket customer behavior in Colombo, Sri Lankan context, using two datasets, having product name, brand name, unit price, quantity and total amount as variables and with two main data mining methodologies. Descriptive analysis revealed that supermarkets SM3 and SM2 (real names are labelled) are experiencing good sales, with vegetables and fruits on top, and rush days for grocery shopping are Saturdays or Thursdays and Fridays.
Market Basket Analysis (MBA), through Apriori and FP-Tree algorithms are association rule mining techniques to uncover relationships among objects. The study utilized methods like K-means, Hierarchical clustering, and Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA, a document clustering method) for consumer segmentation, identifying different customer groups in the market.
Firstly MBA, uncovered rules for products, enabling future promotional discounts. Also 10 rules for product categories like Beverages, Biscuits, Snacks, Confectionaries, and Personal care products were mined for planogram purposes. The method effectively enhanced customer engagement and provided insight into purchasing trends. Secondly, used Hierarchical clustering average linkage method (with elbow plot and dendrograms), to segment consumers into "Premium" and "Standard" based on their expenditure, revealing that Premium customers spend 3.5 times more than Standard customers. Consumers characterized by their product choices using LDA method (based on best Silhouette score of 0.622), as 'Balanced lifestyle seekers', 'Balanced diet consumers', 'Food explorers', 'Indulgence seekers' and 'Whole-food consumers'. The research on grocery items aims to enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty by examining customer behavior dynamics and tailoring marketing strategies.

Key words: Data mining, clustering, association rule mining, machine learning, market basket analysis
