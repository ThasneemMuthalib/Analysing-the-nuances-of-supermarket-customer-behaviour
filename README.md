Analyzing the nuances of supermarket customer behaviour for  enhanced retail marketing strategies: A case study on customer purchases within Colombo area

For merchants to create and implement efficient marketing strategies that can boost sales and customer loyalty, it is essential to analyze the subtleties of supermarket customer behavior. Retailers can customize their marketing efforts to match their customers' demands and offer individualized shopping experiences by learning about their consumers' spending habits, buying tendencies, and preferences. Retailers may benefit from increased consumer satisfaction and loyalty, which could boost sales and profitability. Retailers may also remain ahead of the competition and make wise business decisions by studying customer behavior to help them spot industry trends and possibilities. Hence, retailers wishing to enhance their retail marketing tactics and spur business growth, may find it beneficial to invest in the analysis of supermarket patron behavior. Thus, the study was conducted on two paths to get more insights of customers. Association rules were mined using the popular algorithms Apriori and Fp-tree which resulted in 3508 rules where products along with their brands were included for future promotional discounts with a threshold support of 0.0007 and lift setting up to 1. In case of only considering product categories, Apriori algorithm resulted in 10 rules incorporating related five types of categories, Beverages, Biscuits, Snacks, Confectionaries and Personal care products with a minimum support of 0.05 and a lift of 1. As these related items are bought by customers, next was paying attention to them. As the second objective, consumer segmentation was performed on 131 households which resulted in two unique groups **‘Premium customers’** with 42 observations and **‘Standard customers'** containing 89 customers, who are likely to spend three and half times lesser than the Premium customers. These results were obtained using Hierarchical clustering average linkage cosine distance measure, after comparing results with k-means, K-prototype and Partitioning algorithms which resulted with the best average silhouette score as 0.622. Five optimal groups were figured out using Latent Dirichlet allocation with regard to the products they bought. They are, **‘Balanced lifestyle seekers’, ‘Balanced diet consumers’, ‘Food explorers’, ‘Indulgence seekers’, and ‘Whole-food consumers’**. As the third objective, a mixed model was fitted using Random Forest algorithm/ MERF which has an R squared value of 81.28% and 0.4326 RMSE value. A customer can predict their next invoice amount, if they know the visiting supermarket, buying products and visiting day beforehand. All these findings can be incorporated together to enhance the retail marketing stratergies especially in supermarkets.
